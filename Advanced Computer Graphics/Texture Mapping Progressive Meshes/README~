Installation:
	1) Install all the required libraries (SOIL and opengl).
	2) Move to src directory (>>cd [path-to-src])
	3) Compile (>>make all)
	4) Run (>>./tmpm)

Scene Description:
	1) A robot is moving in a park like environment.
	2) There is drone fly independently of the robot in the park.
	3) When robot calls (user presses button) it, the drone comes and sit on the robot.
	4) Scene Graph: Root -> (robot body, drone) ; Robot body -> (Head, 2 x arms, 2 x legs)

User Interaction options:

	ZOOM-IN/OUT  					----- >/<
	ROTATE   							----- Mouse Right key + drag
	Toggle Wireframe 			----- w
	Reduce Polygons 			----- s
	Increase Polygons 		----- a
	Exit          				----- esc
	

Program Features:

	1) Program implements a texture mapped progressive mesh from scratch 
	2) Entire program is built using MVC architecture.
	3) A graphical user interface is provided for easy user interaction using QT.
	4) The program can handle any given .ply files and textures once files are named accordingly.
