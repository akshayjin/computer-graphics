Installation:
	1) Install all the required libraries (SOIL and opengl).
	2) Move to src directory (>>cd [path-to-src])
	3) Compile (>>make all)
	4) Run (>>./tmpm)

Scene Description:
	1) A model of stanford bunny is loaded.
	2) It is divided into charts based on geometry.
	3) Face polygon are broken down while keeping the process chart complaint.

User Interaction options:

	ZOOM-IN/OUT  					----- >/<
	ROTATE   							----- Mouse Right key + drag
	Toggle Wireframe 			----- w
	Reduce Polygons 			----- s
	Increase Polygons 		----- a

Program Features:

	1) Program implements a texture mapped progressive mesh from scratch.
	2) It uses simplified error function for edge collapse as given by Stan Melax in game 
			dev magazine, November 1998.
	3) Generation of texture file by mapping 3D charts onto 2D image with subsequent filters
		 is not included in the code.
