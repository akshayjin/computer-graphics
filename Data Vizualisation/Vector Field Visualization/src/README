Special Functions (All Capital characters)

	Toggle vector visualization(glyph/streamline)	------ g
	Toggle glyph scaling mode  										------ m 
	Toggle streamline drawing style								------ ' ' (spacebar)
	Increase/Decrease Streamline thickness				------ t/T
	Increase/Decrease Streamline length						------ +/-
	Randomize seed points 												------ j

Program Features:

	1) Implemented both Euler and Runge-Kutta 4th order for streamline.
	2) Implemented different types of streamlines (colormapped polyline and polyline with transparency linearly decreasing along the streamline for arrow like effect).
	
Program drawbacks:
	
	1) Indian subcontinent is not clearly visible in streamline graph.
